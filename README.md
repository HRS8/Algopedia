# **How to Contribute?**

1. **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the Algopedia repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository that you can work on without affecting the original.

2. **Clone the repository**: Once you have forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the `git clone` command. This will create a local copy of the repository that you can edit and modify.

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch in your local copy of the repository that will contain your changes. This can be done using the `git branch` command.

4. **Make your changes**: Make the changes or additions to the repository that you want to contribute. This could be adding a new algorithm or improving an existing one.

5. **Test your changes**: Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work correctly and do not introduce any new issues.

6. **Commit your changes**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your local branch using the `git commit` command.

7. **Push your changes**: Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub using the `git push` command.

8. **Create a pull request**: Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to merge your changes with the original Algopedia repository. This can be done through the GitHub UI by clicking on the "New pull request" button.

9. **Wait for review**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers of the Algopedia repository. They may request changes or ask for more information before merging your changes.

10. **Merge your changes**: Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they can be merged into the original Algopedia repository by the maintainers.

### **Note**: 
1. Make sure you have add your algorithm file path inside `./Algorithms.json` to display changes on website.
2. Make sure every `title` in AllAlgorithms.json should be unique.

# **Data Structure & Algorithms üìà**

### What is Data Structure?<br>

- A data structure is a way to store and organize data in memory in order to facilitate access and modifications.
  <br>

### What is Algorithms? <br>

- An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.

## **Characteristics of a Data Structure**

**Correctness** ‚àí Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.
</br>

**Time Complexity** ‚àí Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
</br>

**Space Complexity** ‚àí Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
